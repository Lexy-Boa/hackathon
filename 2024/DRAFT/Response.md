# Part I of V - Expert opinion on "Relevant Consuming Public"
1. USPTO has fundamentally erred as LexDAO is financed by Retroactive Public Goods Funding [^RPGF], the public are beneficiaries of `lex automata pro public` - computational law as public good
2. Supporting evidence in recent Optimism grant
3. Allocaion process is based on impact, including thought leadership in crypto
4. Decision made by experts from technical computing domain and not general public
5. LexDAO has mindshare but lacks legal protection of its name to non-legal engineers

# Part II of V - LexDAO is (technically) suggestive

# Part III of V - LexDAO has acquired secondary meaning (alternatively)

# Part IV of V - Grant is less inconsistent with provisions of TRIPs

# Part V of V - Concurrent Collective Membership mark
