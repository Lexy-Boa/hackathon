#  Abductive vs Deductive vs Inductive reasoning

## [Abductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning)

> [!TIP]
> Procede no further and accept supplemental registry
> 
> Correct decision for resource-constrained clients (best of a bad lot)

- seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations
- yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it
- diagnostic "expert" systems frequently employ abduction

## [Deductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)

> [!TIP]
> Competent evidence to challenge the USPTO conclusion
> 
> Legal problem solving in client's interest

- premise(s) ➡️ inferences ↪️ conclusion
- Logos appeals to reason, building up logical arguments = better aim
- Ethos appeals to the speaker's status or authority = bigger gun
- Pathos appeals to the emotions (angry or sympathetic) = go vegan

## [Inductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning)

> [!TIP]
> What is the spectrum of outcomes and identify paths for mini-max cost-benefits

-  principles are derived from a body of observations
-  truth of conclusion is probable, based upon the evidence
-  humans don't handle uncertainty well, but new knowledge can be generated

I looked at the Yaga Labs case which suggest USPTO can change its practices.
